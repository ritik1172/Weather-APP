<h2>üî∑ Functionality</h2>

* The app fetches weather data from Open Weather API based on user input (location search or current location).
* Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units for temperature display.
* 3 hous data and daily weather data.
* Weather information is displayed dynamically, including temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and humidity.
* There are buttons through which users can view the weather data of specific locations.

<br />
<br />


<h2>‚úÖ API Integration </h2>

* The app integrates with Open Weather API to fetch real-time weather data for different locations.
* API requests are handled using asynchronous JavaScript (async/await) to ensure smooth data retrieval and updates.

<br />
<br />


<h2>üíª Code Structure and Organization </h2>

* The codebase is structured following best practices, with modular components, reusable styles, and clear separation of concerns.
* ### Folder Structure
---
* **components/**: Contains reusable React components such as `TopButton`, `Inputs`, `TimeAndLocation`, `TempAndDetails`, and `Forecast`.
*  **services/**: Includes API integration logic, specifically the `weatherService.js` file for fetching weather data.
*  **App.js**: Main application file that brings together all components and logic.
*  **index.js**: Entry point for the React application.


<br />
<br />



<h2>‚úè Challenges and Limitations </h2>

* One challenge was optimizing API requests to minimize server load and improve app performance. This was addressed by implementing caching mechanisms and optimizing data fetching logic.
* The app uses the free version of the OpenWeather API, which limits the number of requests that can be sent. This can affect the frequency of updates and the ability to handle a large number of users simultaneously.'
